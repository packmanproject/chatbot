I have done that with my Sony, Kobo &amp; Smashwords ebooks. I used to have a Sony ereader, and when I switched to nook, I downloaded the Sony ebooks to my computer, hooked up my nook to the computer, and dragged the ebook files to an SD card that I had loaded on my nook. Same with my Kobo &amp; Smashword ebooks. Another option would be to see if there is a BooksAMillion app in the google play store. You could load the app on your nook, sign in to your BooksAMillion account on the app, and your library will show up within the app. I also just went to the BooksAMillion website and it appears that they used to sell Nook devices on their site, so I'm sure that would indicate it is compatible. Hope these suggestions are helpful and you can always visit a Barnes &amp; Noble store Nook counter and the sales staff can assist you with any questions.</td>\n",

       "82  I believe as long as the ebooks are epub, you should be able to side load them to your nook or side load them to an sd card. I have done that with my Sony, Kobo & Smashwords ebooks. I used to have a Sony ereader, and when I switched to nook, I downloaded the Sony ebooks to my computer, hooked up my nook to the computer, and dragged the ebook files to an SD card that I had loaded on my nook. Same with my Kobo & Smashword ebooks. Another option would be to see if there is a BooksAMillion app in the google play store. You could load the app on your nook, sign in to your BooksAMillion account on the app, and your library will show up within the app. I also just went to the BooksAMillion website and it appears that they used to sell Nook devices on their site, so I'm sure that would indicate it is compatible. Hope these suggestions are helpful and you can always visit a Barnes & Noble store Nook counter and the sales staff can assist you with any questions.  \n",

If the battery does not have enough charge, it will just light up briefly and shut off.
